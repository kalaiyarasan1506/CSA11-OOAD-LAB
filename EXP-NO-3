1.2 PROBLEM ANALYSIS AND PROJECT PLANNING
20	+
The Exam Registration is an application in which applicant can register themselves for
21	+
the exam. The details of the students who have registered for the examination will be stored in a
22	+
database and will be maintained. The registered details can then be verified for any fraudulent or
23	+
duplication and can be removed if found so. The database which is verified can be used to issue
24	+
hall tickets and other necessary materials to the eligible students.
25	+
1.3 PROJECT DESCRIPTION:
26	+
This software is designed for the verification of the details of the candidate by the central
27	+
computer. The details regarding the candidate will be provided to the central computer through
28	+
the administrator and the computer will verify the details of candidate and provide approval
29	+
.Then the hall ticket will be issued from the office to the candidate.

USE CASE DIAGRAM:
35	+
This diagram will contain the actors, use cases which are given below
36	+
Actors: Student, educational officer..
37	+
Use case: Student details, student photo, student proof submission of proof
38	+
,verification of proof, payment of fees, issue of hall ticket.
39	+

42	+
CLASS DIAGRAM:
43	+
This diagram consists of the following classes, attributes and their operations
44	+
CLASSES ATTRIBUTES OPERATIONS
45	+

52	+
Edu officer Enter details Issue hall ticket(),
53	+

54	+
55	+
ACTIVITY DIAGRAM:
56	+
This diagram will have the activities as Start point, End point, Decision boxes as given
57	+
below:
58	+
59	+
Activities: Enter student details , submit student proof and photo, payment of
60	+
fees, issue of hall ticket.
61	+
Decision box: Verification of proof.
62	+
63	+
SEQUENCE DIAGRAM:
64	+
This diagram consists of the objects, messages and return messages.
65	+
Object: student, educational officer, central education system.
66	+
67	+
COLLABORATION DIAGRAM:
68	+
This diagram contains the objects and actors. This will be obtained by the completion of
69	+
the sequence diagram and pressing the F5 key.
70	+
71	+
STATE CHART DIAGRAM:
72	+
The purpose of state chart diagram is to understand the algorithm involved in performing
73	+
a method. It is also called as state diagram. A state is represented as a round box, which may
74	+
contain one or more compartments. An initial state is represented as small dot. A final state is
75	+
represented as circle surrounding a small dot.
76	+
77	+
COMPONENT DIAGRAM:
78	+
The component diagram&#39;s main purpose is to show the structural relationships between
79	+
the components of a system. It is represented by boxed figure. Dependencies are represented by
80	+
communication association
81	+
82	+
DEPLOYMENT DIAGRAM:
83	+
A deployment diagram in the unified modeling language serves to model the physical
84	+
deployment of artifacts on deployment targets. Deployment diagrams show &quot;the allocation of
85	+
artifacts to nodes according to the Deployments defined between them. It is represented by 3-
86	+
dimentional box. Dependencies are represented by communication association.
87	+
88	+
PACKAGE DIAGRAM:
89	+
90	+
A package diagram in unified modeling language that depicts the dependencies
91	+
between the packages that make up a model. A Package Diagram (PD) shows a grouping of
92	+
elements in the OO model, and is a Cradle extension to UML. PDs can be used to show groups
93	+
of classes in Class Diagrams (CDs), groups of components or processes in Component Diagrams
94	+
(CPDs), or groups of processors in Deployment Diagrams (DPDs).
95	+
There are three types of layer. They are
96	+
o User interface layer
97	+
o Domain layer
98	+
o Technical services layer

117	+
}
118	+
Public void issue hall ticket()
119	+
{
120	+
}
121	+
}
122	+
123	+
STUDENT:
124	+
Public class student
125	+
{
126	+
Public integer student details;
127	+
Public void payment of fees()
128	+
{
129	+
}
130	+
Public void receive hall ticket()
131	+
132	+
{
133	+
}
134	+
}
135	+
136	+
RESULT:
137	+

138	+
component, deployment, package] for the Exam registration system.
