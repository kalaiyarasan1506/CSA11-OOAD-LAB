USECASE DIAGRAM:
29 +
This diagram will contain the attributes as start point, end point, decision box as
30 +

31 +
given below
32 +

33 +
34 +
35 +
ACTORS: Purchase product, Server, Central system
36 +
USECASE: Product, Voice, Non-Voice, Indian office, Employee, Feedback.
37 +
CLASS DIAGRAM:
38 +
This Diagram consists of the following classes, attributes and their operations.
39 +
40 +
CLASSES ATTRIBUTES OPERATIONS
41 +
Central System Store, update Storing(), updating()
42 +
Dealer Employee name Delivery()
43 +
Customer Details Feedback()
44 +
45 +
ACTIVITY DIAGRAM:
46 +
This diagram will contain the activities as start point, end point, decision boxes as given
47 +
below
48 +
ACTIVITIES: Purchase Product, On call, On chat
49 +
DECISION BOX: Option to check
50 +
SEQUENCE DIAGRAM:
51 +
This diagram consists of the objects, messages and return messages
52 +
Object: Customer, Dealer, Central System
53 +
COLLABORATION DIAGRAM:
54 +
This diagram contains the objects and actors. This will be obtained by the completion of the sequence diagram and pressing F5 key
55 +
56 +
STATECHART DIAGRAM:
57 +
It is a technique to describe the behavior of the system. It describes all the possible states that a particular object gets into the object oriented technique. State diagram are drawn for a single class to show to the lifetime behaviour of a single objects
58 +
COMPONENT DIAGRAM:
59 +
The component diagram is represented by figure dependency and it is a graph of design of figure dependency. The component diagram's main purpose is to show the structural relationships between the components of a systems. It is represented by boxed figure. Dependencies are represented by communication association.
60 +
DEPLOYMENT DIAGRAM:
61 +
A deployment diagram in the unified modeling language serves to model the physical deployment of artifacts on deployment targets. Deployment diagrams show "the allocation of artifacts to nodes according to the Deployments defined between them. It is represented by 3- dimentional box. Dependencies are represented by communication association
62 +
PACKAGE DIAGRAM:
63 +
A package diagram in unified modeling language that depicts the dependencies between the packages that make up a model. A Package Diagram (PD) shows a grouping of elements in the OO model, and is a Cradle extension to UML. PDs can be used to show groups of classes in Class Diagrams (CDs), groups of components or processes in Component Diagrams (CPDs), or groups of processors in Deployment Diagrams (DPDs).
64 +
There are three types of layer. They are
65 +
o User interface layer
66 +
67 +
o Domain layer
68 +
o Technical services layer
