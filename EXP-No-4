1.2 PROBLEM ANALYSIS AND PROJECT PLANNING :
21	+
The Stock Maintenance System, initial requirement to develop the project about the
22	+
mechanism of the Stock Maintenance System is caught from the customer. The requirement are
23	+
analyzed and refined which enables the end users to efficiently use Stock Maintenance System.
24	+
The complete project is developed after the whole project analysis explaining about the scope
25	+
and the project statement is prepared.
26	+
1.3PROJECT DESCRIPTION:
27	+
This software is designed for supporting the computerized stock maintainence System .In
28	+
this system, the customer can place order and purchase items with the aid of the stock dealer and
29	+
central stock system. This orders are verified and the items are delivered to the customer.

USE CASE DIAGRAM:
33	+
This diagram will contain the actors, use cases which are given below
34	+
Actors: Customer, Stock dealer, central stock system.
35	+
Use case: purchase order, verification of order, payment ,delivery of items.
36	+
37	+
38	+
CLASS DIAGRAM:
39	+
This diagram consists of the following classes, attributes and their operations.
40	+
CLASSES ATTRIBUTES OPERATIONS
41	+
Central stock system Store stock details Print bill()
42	+
43	+
ACTIVITY DIAGRAM:
44	+
This diagram will have the activities as Start point ,End point, Decision boxes as given
45	+
below:
46	+
Activities: Purchase order, payment , delivery of items.
47	+
Decision box: Valid or not
48	+
49	+
SEQUENCE DIAGRAM:
50	+
This diagram consists of the objects, messages and return messages.
51	+
Object: Customer, Stock dealer, Central stock system
52	+
53	+
COLLABORATION DIAGRAM:
54	+
This diagram contains the objects and actors. This will be obtained by the completion of
55	+
the sequence diagram and pressing the F5 key.
56	+
57	+
STATE CHART DIAGRAM:
58	+
The purpose of state chart diagram is to understand the algorithm involved in performing
59	+
a method. It is also called as state diagram. A state is represented as a round box, which may
60	+
contain one or more compartments. An initial state is represented as small dot. A final state is
61	+
represented as circle surrounding a small dot.
62	+
63	+
COMPONENT DIAGRAM:
64	+
The component diagram&#39;s main purpose is to show the structural relationships between
65	+
the components of a system. It is represented by boxed figure. Dependencies are represented by
66	+
communication association
67	+
68	+
DEPLOYMENT DIAGRAM:
69	+
A deployment diagram in the unified modeling language serves to model the physical
70	+
deployment of artifacts on deployment targets. Deployment diagrams show &quot;the allocation of
71	+
artifacts to nodes according to the Deployments defined between them. It is represented by 3-
72	+
dimentional box. Dependencies are represented by communication association.
73	+
74	+
75	+
PACKAGE DIAGRAM:
76	+
77	+
A package diagram in unified modeling language that depicts the dependencies
78	+
between the packages that make up a model. A Package Diagram (PD) shows a grouping of
79	+
elements in the OO model, and is a Cradle extension to UML. PDs can be used to show groups
80	+

of classes in Class Diagrams (CDs), groups of components or processes in Component Diagrams
86	+
(CPDs), or groups of processors in Deployment Diagrams (DPDs).
87	+
There are three types of layer. They are
88	+
o User interface layer
89	+
o Domain layer
90	+
o Technical services layer
